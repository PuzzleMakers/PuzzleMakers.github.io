# Welcome!

Welcome to the Puzzle Makers Wiki! Our goal is to be a useful resource for designing and analyzing Twisty Puzzles. This site is a collaboration between members of the [Puzzle Makers Discord](https://discord.gg/VbxpsU46dT). We are not directly affiliated with the [Twisty Puzzles Forum](https://twistypuzzles.com/forum/index.php), though of course there is a lot of overlap.

This wiki is currently split into three sections.

### [Theory](theory/theory.md)
Puzzle Theory deals in the mathematical analysis of twisty puzzles. Some concepts include Grip Theory, applications of Group Theory, and various conjectures and properties of puzzles, such as Oskar and benpuzzle's [Simple Deep Cut Conjecture](https://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=350799#p350799).

### [Design](design/design.md)
The aim of the Design section is to provide resources so that anyone may design their own twisty puzzles. 
Some topics include strategies for choosing axis systems, Intro to CAD, and tutorials for advanced puzzle making techniques, such as hyperbolic cuts and shell puzzles. 

### [Production](production/production.md)
The Production section helps bring puzzle designs to life. Some topics include choosing a 3d printer, choosing good print orientations, and tips for post processing.
